// things that the drawer can do:
//   draw a path using a color, which may be the hardstreak color (the player color)
//   draw that path using a custom blending function and equation
//   skip drawing if the hardstreak is marked as solid/nonsolid
//   additionally, you can specify an opacity factor (gets multiplied by the parent hardstreak opacity to get a final opacity)
//      e.g. the inner white part of the wave trail is 65% opacity (0.65f), the outer part is 100% opacity (1.f)
