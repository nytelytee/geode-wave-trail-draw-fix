# Wave Trail Draw Fix

Fix the wave trail drawing algorithm.

There is also a visualizer included (visualizer.py; requires matplotlib and numpy).

Note: the more powerful version of the api on this branch, with custom node capability, does not work when shaders are applied to the trail, so it has been discontinued. If you can fix it with shaders, please do, then a new major version may be released.
